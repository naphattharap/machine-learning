# machine-learning
Inside this folder, you will see the implementation of different algorithms and tasks in Machine Learning. I also explained Python source code at the same time. In each jupyter notebook file, I focused on different part in machine learning. So, there is a step of learning if you would like to understand Machine Learning step by step. In case you would like to find example source code for fixing issues in your program. Feel free to jump to that part. ^^
